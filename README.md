# Nether Star Block ([Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nether-star-block), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/nether-star-block))
Minecraft mod that adds a single nether star block.

To craft it, use 9 nether stars. Like the nether star, it cannot be destroyed from explosions, even in its item form.

This mod is mostly intended to be used by other mods or modpacks as a challenging crafting ingredient. However, you can also use it as a shiny and cool looking trophy.
