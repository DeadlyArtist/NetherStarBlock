# Nether Star Block ([Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nether-star-block), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/nether-star-block))
Minecraft mod that adds a single nether star block.

To craft it, use 9 nether stars. Like the nether star, it cannot be destroyed from explosions, even in its item form. This includes immunity to both the dragon and the wither.

Additional Notes:  
It can be used in place of a bookshelf to power your enchantment table  
It resonates vibrations like an amethyst block  
Piglins will guard it  
You need at least a diamond pickaxe to destroy it  

This mod is mostly intended to be used by other mods or modpacks as a challenging crafting ingredient. However, you can also use it as a shiny and cool looking trophy.
